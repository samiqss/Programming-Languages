This README includes a short overview of the example1.cl script
   provided in this repository, plus the requirements for the
   lab 1 take home exercise (due exactly 6 days after the start
   of your registered lab session).

Supplied file: example1.cl
--------------------------

example1.cl is an executable script that prompts the user to enter
   an integer, checks the data entered is indeed an integer, and
   (if so) displays its square.  

   The script demonstrates the creation and use of a 'main' function
   in lisp, and can be run with the command
      ./example1.cl

Lab requirements:
-----------------

Create an executable lisp script named lab1.cl to hold your lab code
   (make sure you get the name EXACTLY correct, all lower-case)

Note: you can make the script executable using the command
   chmod u+x lab1.cl
and you can then run your script using the command
   ./lab1.cl

Your script must define a function named summation that takes three parameters.
The function returns the sum of all the parameters whose values are numeric,
    defaulting to 0 if none of the parameters are numeric.
e.g.  (summation 1 2 3) would return 6
      (summation nil 25.4  "foo") would return 25.4
      (summation "x" "y" "z") would return 0
The function should NOT produce any output (i.e. no error messages).

Your script must define a function named classify that takes one parameter,
  and displays a message indicating if the parameter supplied is a number,
  a string, a list, or 'something else'.   The results of several sample calls are
  illustrated below:
     (classify 3.5)      ; displays "3.5 is a number"
     (classify '(1 2 3)) ; displays "(1 2 3) is a list"
     (classify "hello")  ; displays "hello is a string"
     (classify #\Q)      ; displays "#\Q is something else"

Your script must define a function named main that does the following:
  1. uses a let block to declare three local variables
  2. prompts the user to enter three numbers
  3. reads the user's responses, storing them in the three variables
  4. calls the classify function on each of the three variables, in order
  5. calls the summation function, passing it the three variables,
     and displaying the values entered and results in the format:
        "The sum of X, Y, and Z is: A"
     (where X, Y, and Z are the three values entered, whether they are
      numeric or not, and A is the value returned by summation).

Finally, your script must call your main function.

Sample run:
-----------
(The sample run below shows the user entering 13 "abc" and (1 2)
 as their three values.)

   Please enter three numbers:
   13 "abc" (1 2)
   13 is a number
   abc is a string
   (1 2) is a list
   The sum of 13, abc, and (1 2) is: 13

Submitting the lab:
-------------------

To submit the lab for grading, be sure to perform all the following once your lab is complete:

   git add lab1.cl
   git commit -m "completed lab1"
   git push
