This README provides the specifications for the lab 7 take home
   exercise (which is due exactly 6 days after the start of your
   registered lab session).

Lab requirements:
-----------------

For this lab you will be experimenting with various C programs
to answer each of the questions below.

Twelve programs, lab7a.c through lab7L.c, are provided,
along with a makefile.

Put your answers to the questions in file lab7.txt.

(1) For each of the programs, when compiled with gcc -Wall, indicate whether they
      - compiled cleanly
      - compiled but with warnings
      - failed to compile (generated errors)

(2) For those that failed to compile, what was the root cause of the problem?
       If there is a simple/reasonable fix to eliminate the error, briefly
       describe what that fix would be.

(3) Of the programs from part (1) that did compile (cleanly or not),
       which ones caused a runtime crash and why?  Be as clear as possible
       about the root cause of the problem, and if there is a simple/reasonable
       fix to eliminate the crash briefly describe what the fix would be.

(4) Of the programs from part (1) that did compile (cleanly or not) and
       ran without crashing, which ones resulted in a loss of data and why?

(5) Of the assignment statements from part (1) that compiled cleanly, ran
       without a crash, and caused no loss of data,  which ones (if any)
       would you regard as a dangerous programming practice?
       Justify your answer.
