Lab 11 overview:
----------------

This repository contains the files necessary to use smart pointers
to maintain a pool of key-value pairs.

The file pool.h contains the definition of a KVPair class (to hold a
single key-value pair), as well as a Pool class, to maintain the
collection of key-value pairs.  The implementations of the associated
methods are provided in file pool.cpp, and a main routine using them
is provided in file lab11.cpp.

The objective of this lab is to modify the Pool class to make it
a templated class - i.e. so it could be used as a pool of any type
of class, rather than just a pool of KVPairs.

You will need to modify pool.h and pool.cpp to create the templated class,
and modify lab11.cpp to use the templated class correctly with the KVPairs.

As always, be sure to do your git add/commit/push prior to the
lab deadline.
