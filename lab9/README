This README provides the specifications for the lab 9 take home
   exercise (which is due exactly 6 days after the start of your
   registered lab session).


Repository contents:
--------------------
  README - this file
  template.cpp  - example of variadic functions in C++
  lab9.cpp      - skeleton lab9 file for the C++ portion
  varArgs.c     - example of variadic functions in C
  lab9.c        - skeleton lab9 file for the C portion
  makefile - to compile the .cpp and .c files listed

Lab requirements:
-----------------
For this lab you'll be implementing functions that accept a variable number
of parameters in two ways:
  (1) using C stdarg macros (put your solution in lab9.c)
  (2) using C++ templates   (put your solution in lab9.cpp)

An example of each has been provided in the template.cpp and varArgs.c files
  included in the repository, along with a makefile for all four files.

The required behaviour for the variadic functions is described in lab9.c and lab9.cpp,
along with a short sample main routine.

Submitting
----------
Make sure you have added, committed, and pushed your completed work, e.g.

   git add .
   git commit -m "lab 9 completed"
   git push
