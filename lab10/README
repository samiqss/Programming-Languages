This README provides the specifications for the lab 10 take home
   exercise (which is due exactly 6 days after the start of your
   registered lab session).


Repository contents:
--------------------
  README - this file
  template.cpp  - example of templated function pointer use in C++
  lab10.cpp      - skeleton lab10 file for the C++ portion
  makefile - to compile the .cpp and .c files listed

Lab requirements:
-----------------
For this lab you'll be implementing a C++ version of apply:
    a function that takes a function and data values as its
    parameters, runs the function on the data values,
    and returns the result.

The required behaviour for the apply function is described in lab10.cpp,
along with a short sample main routine to test it.

Submitting
----------
Make sure you have added, committed, and pushed your completed work, e.g.

   git add .
   git commit -m "lab 10 completed"
   git push
