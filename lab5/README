This README provides the specifications for the lab 5 take home
   exercise (which is due exactly 6 days after the start of your
   registered lab session).

Lab requirements:
-----------------

Create an executable lisp script named lab5.cl to hold your lab code
   (make sure you get the name EXACTLY correct, all lower-case)

This lab involves the creation and use of lisp macros.

In this case, your script must define a defmacro named listtype
   with the behaviour specified in the supplied lab5.cl file.

As always make sure your macro is named correctly (correct spelling,
   correct case) and that it expands to the expected code (again, as
   detailed in lab5.cl)

At the bottom of the lab5.cl file you will find a short sample call 
that tries expanding/displaying and testing a use of your macro. 

Your lab5.cl should be expanded to add additional tests of your macro -
showing its expansion and use in a variety of test cases (using varying
numbers of arguments and type checking functions).

Submitting
----------
Make sure you have added, committed, and pushed your completed work, e.g.

   git add .
   git commit -m "lab 5 completed"
   git push
